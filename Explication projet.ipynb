Part I focused on a popularity-based approach, recommending popular products to new customers. Part II introduced a model-based collaborative filtering system, utilizing a utility matrix and SVD to identify product similarities based on user purchase history.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"oCm0s8gyG7xQ"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"TtHmHOdBG7KA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1705432815937,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":21541,"user":{"displayName":"Matteo Desse","userId":"02344303246384087042"}},"outputId":"a016e077-021c-453f-998a-aa4bb2cd752f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]}]}
